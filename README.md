# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Implementation Project

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It explains how software is planned, designed, developed, tested, deployed, and maintained using standard SDLC principles.

## Project Description
The project was developed to show how each phase of the SDLC is applied in a real software development process. The implementation aligns with the explanations of each SDLC phase.

## SDLC Phases
1. Requirements Analysis – identifying user needs and system requirements.
2. System Design – creating the structure and architecture of the software.
3. Implementation – writing the program code.
4. Testing – checking the system for errors and correcting them.
5. Deployment – releasing the software for use.
6. Maintenance – updating and improving the system after deployment.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- GitHub

## How to Run the Project
